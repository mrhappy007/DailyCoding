## Exercise00 NoTeenSum + Unit Test
Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum.
However, if any of the values is a teen
-- in the range 13..19 inclusive --
then that value counts as 0,
except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens

 ### For example:
no_teen_sum(1, 2, 3) → 6
no_teen_sum(2, 13, 1) → 3
no_teen_sum(2, 1, 14) → 3

## Exercise 1
Given a list of numbers and a number k.
Return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example:
Give [1,2,3,4] and k of 7
Return true since 3 + 4 is 7

## Exercise 2
Given an array of integers,
return a new array
such that each element at index i of the new array
is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24].

If our input was [3, 2, 1],
the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
